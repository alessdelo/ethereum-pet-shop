# Truffle tutorial - ethereum-pet-shop (on heroku)

This is a version of the Truffle tutorial "ethereum-pet-shop" that runs on a remote server with heroku.

In order to do it I made some changes to make this tutorial compatible with Heroku standards. 

1) Added heroku "Procfile" file

2) Added heroku "app.json" file

3) Canged node  file "package.json"

        - added infos a bout node version"
